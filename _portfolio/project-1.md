In this project,  I constructed a simple 5-stage pipeline MPIS-based processor following the tutorial in the book (https://book.douban.com/subject/25960657/).  It is in Havard architecture and supports exception handling and six external interrupts. It supports all integer instructions in MPIS32 ISA and single-cycle multiplication.
