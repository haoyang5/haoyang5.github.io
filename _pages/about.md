I obtained my B.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering from the City University of Hong Kong in 2022. Then I joined the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, ECE departments as an MPhil student, supervised by Dr. ZHANG Wei. My major research interest is in FPGA-based accelerations for machine learning and hardware & software co-design.
