I obtained my B.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from City University of Hong Kong in 2022. Then I joined the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, ECE departments as a MPhil student, supervised by Dr. ZHANG Wei. My major interest is in FPGA based accelerations for machine learning and embedded system.
